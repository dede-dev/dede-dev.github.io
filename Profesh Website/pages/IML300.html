  Diagrams are a more thoughtful (in the sense that you must use thought instead of observation) way to understand concepts in art and general meaning. I feel like diagrams make late night thoughts understandable, but I also think that sometimes it is hard to make diagrams that make sense when you connect everything because something things don't connect when you think about them but they make sense in other ways.

  The hold that Ayn Rand had over entrepreneurs and I feel like tech giants still idolize her/bring similar ideas to the work they create. I feel like Elon Musk is the epitome of that as he; he is mostly interested in things that will benefit him or be funny to him, etc. and the idea of having billions of dollars and hoarding wealth shows self-interest as well - very fitting of Silicon Valley. Californian ideology is radical individualism and utiopian theories about computer tech. It says the world was one interconnected system and politicians shouldn't control the system, although at the time this concept was created Bill Clinton became president and wanted to control the internet

  Hito Steyerl's reading comes at a very timely place in my process of making and understanding not only my own art but the art of the students around me currently. For a recent project, I wanted the ISO for some shots I was filming to be low so that there would appear to be some film grain. I was trying to represent the feeling of "sehnsucht" which is the feeling of wanting something unattainable or unattainable happiness. However, for me this also overlapped with nostaglia. And it is interesting to hear about the poor image because I purposefully made my image not look clean and focused in order to replicate an older/distorted image. I think my generation has grown up in the time in between tiny square televisions and flat screen tvs, so this movement of finding old videos and reposting them to YouTube makes sense because it is almost as though we are trying to fulfill our nostalgia of our brief time with distorted images on screens. For example, with Vine and now Tiktok people are recording videos on their phones for entertainment but worldwide people enjoy them, repost them, make compilations of them, insert them into unrelated videos, etc., even though they are not pristine images our generation has become comfortable with looking at these raw videos and allowed ourselves to see past the quality. I feel like this is harmless and as Hito said it is changing the world of film and entertainment because not every kid is looking for the best looking image in order to be entertained, one just needs to find a funny person and give them a low quality phone and any kid watching would enjoy it. Although I think that artists today are using these "nostalgic" images to simple sell more products to our generation, and a lot of artists doing this are from our generation. The aesthetic of the poor image is being used to sell a reality that we do not live in but it is making our generation want to live in it. However, as Hito said not every culture's videos and images that were of a poor quality had the opportunity to be saved properly throughout history so a lot of history has been lost. Meaning there is a certain demographic(s) that exist within the poor images we have access to today. I think the artists who know about the poor images available to the public are trying to sell the aesthetic of the very white/European and "more acceptable" poor image, and it is less experimental, less about documentation of something unique and beautiful and more just selling an aesthetic that the artist might not even believe is the reality we live in - but they know people will buy into it. For example, Soul Train is definitely a series that the public can research, however, it is probably not as popular as "Happy Days", "Laverne and Shirley", even "I Love Lucy" a lot of people might enjoy or simply be more educated about the latter shows I mentioned and possibly not be aware of Soul Train. I think what Hito stated in this section is helping me make sense of why I and maybe others might use the aesthetic of the poor image in their work, however I wish I - as well as the others who use this style - could find a more inventive way of using the poor image because a lot of what I have seen is simply using it to sell a nice looking/aethetic idea of what reality could be, while not adding on the fact that people already receive this meaning once they see a poor image.

Cybernetics helped push the idea of (a machine like) stability - that was later found to be just a fantasy. The way people conducted research and led their lives was influenced by the idea that nature was meant to be predictable and make sense and have order. I think since we clung to this idea it can help us understand how humans are either naturally wired to think or how our society's widely held beliefs affect the way we lead our lives. Although I think the hippie communes were truly one of the most important and interesting studies that occured during the time cybernetics became a concept. The fact that even through a system meant to create equality someone would step up and try to assert control is scary and I'm not sure what part of society needs to be changed in order to prevent that from happening. I don't know if cybernetics is a useful tool for discerning reality because it obviously created a movement of people who just wanted order and peace, but it also allows people to keep a status quo alive and prevent our society from being truly equitable - like Wholism.

  I found God in myself, and I loved her fiercely. <br>
  Never religious but it hurt in the best way to hear these words <br>
  I never have to abstract myself again <br>
  To rhyme and have you misunderstand the anguish in my words <br>
  Shange understood. <br>
  I wish I could scream at the towers that knock my people down <br>
  But screaming doesn't do enough. And walking only ruins my shoes <br>
  I want to put my thoughts in your mind and have you see <br>
  How difficult it can be to feel pain when I just want to be free <br>
